    <p>Today, I just want to thank God for another wonderful year—for His unwavering grace 🙏 ❤️, His mercies, His forgiveness, and His unconditional love. Despite my flaws and shortcomings, He has kept me, sustained me, and given me reasons to rejoice. Honestly, without Him, I don't think I would be alive, let alone celebrating my 18th birthday today.

      From the day I was born until this very moment, God has carried me. For that, I am eternally grateful.
      
      Turning 18 is special, it's the age most people say you step into adulthood 😅. At the beginning of this year, I set many ambitious goals for myself. Some I achieved, like becoming a front-end developer (yes, I built this website you're reading from!) 😏. Others I wasn't able to complete 😢,some were sidelined by school, some were too ambitious, and for some, I just wasn't as consistent as I should have been.
      
      But I've learned valuable lessons from both my wins and my losses. Life is about progress, not perfection, and it only truly ends when we give up. So, I pray that by next year, I'll achieve the goals I couldn't reach this year, as well as the new ones I set for myself.
      
      I also want to thank God for my parents—the two wonderful human beings He chose to bring me into this world through. My mother and father are so precious to me, and I know no one else could ever love me the way they do ❤️. I pray that God continues to keep and strengthen them.
      
      I'm also grateful for the kind of friends He has blessed me with 🤗. Their perspectives and worldviews have shaped me into who I am today. Truly, no man is an island, and just as it's the foundation—not the walls—that keeps a house standing, God has given me strong foundations through the people in my life.
      
      I am simply grateful—for life, for love, for growth, and for everything God has given me. May His name forever be praised 🤲❤️.
